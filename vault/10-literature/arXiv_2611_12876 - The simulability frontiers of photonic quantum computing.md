# The simulability frontiers of photonic quantum computing

## Abstract

> Estimates of when photonic devices outgrow classical simulation are hard to compare: even for
> single-photon boson sampling, quoted thresholds range from 50 to 98 photons, as they rest on
> different tasks and assumptions. We propose as a common unit the time a classical computer needs
> to draw one sample from the device's exact output distribution, up to floating-point rounding.
> Only exactness applies equally to every kind of light, since the cost of approximate sampling
> depends on the accuracy required. The simulability frontier is the device size at which our
> fastest exact sampler produces one sample per second on a fixed machine; this device size
> increases with better hardware and algorithms. As the time per sample grows exponentially with
> the number of detected photons, doubling the machine speed moves the frontier by about one
> photon, whereas a better algorithm changes the growth rate. We measure the frontier with
> photonic-engines, an open-source GPU library of exact samplers for single photons, entangled
> photons from quantum emitters, vacuum-single-photon superpositions and squeezed light. Each
> sampler is validated against a simulator sharing no code with it. On one NVIDIA H100 GPU, with
> Haar-random interferometers, twice as many modes as photonic inputs and photon-number-resolving
> detectors, the frontier lies at 38.3 single photons and at 31.0 entangled photons from one
> emitter. For squeezed light, a timing model fitted to measurements places it at 41.5 squeezed
> photonic inputs of mean photon number 0.5. For our samplers, coherence alone makes simulation
> harder: sources that emit a photon with probability one half reach 64.2 when vacuum and photon
> are mixed incoherently, as for lossy single photons, but only 50.0 when they are in coherent
> superposition. Feed-forward from mid-circuit measurement of up to three modes lowers the single-
> photon frontier only from 38.3 to 38.1.
